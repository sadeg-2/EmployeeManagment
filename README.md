# Employee Management System

## Overview

Employee Management is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to streamline HR and organizational workflows. It provides a centralized platform for managing employee records, organizational structure, HR processes, and user authentication, making it ideal for small to medium-sized organizations seeking to digitize and automate their HR operations.

## Main Purpose and Goals

- **Centralize employee data management**: Add, update, delete, and view employee records.
- **Organize departments and locations**: Structure the organization by departments, branches, and locations (country, city, town).
- **Manage HR processes**: Handle vacations, sanctions, doctor recommendations, and more.
- **Secure access**: Provide authentication and authorization for safe data management.

---

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **ASP.NET Core (Web API)**: For robust, scalable RESTful services.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for seamless database interaction (SQL Server).
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Stateless and secure authentication.

### Frontend
- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Build interactive web UIs with C#, enabling code sharing with backend logic.
- **MudBlazor**: UI component library for modern, responsive, and material-styled interfaces.

### Shared/Libraries
- **Custom Service & Repository Layers**: For business logic abstraction and code reuse.
- **Blazored.LocalStorage**: Client-side data persistence (e.g., tokens).
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: Interactive API documentation for easy testing and exploration.

**Why these?**  
These technologies provide an integrated .NET ecosystem, support maintainability, are widely adopted in enterprise settings, and enable rapid, secure development.

## Architecture and Project Structure

The codebase is organized in a layered and modular fashion:

- **Client/**: Blazor WebAssembly project; contains UI components, pages, and state management.
- **Server/**: ASP.NET Core Web API project; contains API endpoints, authentication, and business logic.
- **Client.Library/**: Shared services, contract interfaces, and helpers for client operations.
- **Server.Library/**: Shared data access (repositories), entity definitions, and helpers for server operations.
- **BaseLibrary/**: Core entity models and DTOs, shared across client and server.

Key principles:
- Separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data access.
- Use of Dependency Injection for service/repository management.
- Generic repository and service interfaces for extensible CRUD operations.

---

## Key Features

- **Employee Management**: CRUD operations for employees.
- **Department, Branch, and Location Management**: Organize by department, branch, country, city, and town.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login, JWT-based API protection, custom authentication provider on the client.
- **HR Processes**: Manage vacations, sanctions, doctor visits, and recommendations.
- **Generic CRUD Operations**: Use of generic services and repositories for scalable entity management.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with MudBlazor for a modern, user-friendly experience.
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI available for testing and exploring backend endpoints.

---

## How Components Interact

- **Frontend (Blazor Client)**: Interacts with backend APIs via HTTP, using injected services for data operations.
- **Backend (ASP.NET Core API)**: Handles requests, business logic, and database operations via Entity Framework Core.
- **Shared Libraries**: Contain reusable code (entities, DTOs, services, repository contracts) for consistency and maintainability.
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens issued by the backend, stored by the frontend, and used for secure API access.

---

## Design Patterns & Coding Practices

- **Generic Repository & Service Pattern**: Facilitates code reuse and consistency for CRUD operations.
- **Dependency Injection**: Used throughout for testable, modular code.
- **Layered Architecture**: Promotes maintainability and scalability.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Ensures responsive UI and efficient server processing.

---

## Potential Improvements

- **Automated Testing**: Add unit and integration tests for increased reliability.
- **Advanced Authorization**: Implement user roles and permissions for more granular access control.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add robust error and exception management.
- **Feature Expansion**: Dashboards, analytics, and reporting.
- **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages.
- **API Rate Limiting & Logging**: Improve security and traceability.

## Getting Started (For New Developers)

1. **Clone the repository** and open in Visual Studio or VS Code.
2. **Restore NuGet packages** and client dependencies.
3. **Configure the database** connection string as needed (`Server/appsettings.json`).
4. **Run Entity Framework migrations** to set up the database.
5. **Start both the Server and Client projects** (ensure server runs first to provide the API).
6. **Access the app** via the URL provided by Blazor WebAssembly.
7. **Explore the code**:  
   - Add new entities or features by following the established repository/service patterns.
   - UI components are in `Client/Pages`, backend logic in `Server/Controllers`, shared models in `BaseLibrary`.
